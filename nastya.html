<p> From this article u will rnow a lot of information about capibaras </p>



<p><b>Capybara is the largest rodent in the world.</b> It belongs to the family of water pigs and lives in South America. Externally, the capybara resembles a large guinea pig, only much larger: adults can weigh up to <i>60 kilograms.</i> It has a strong body, short legs, and a large head with kind eyes..</p>

<p><i>These animals lead a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Capybaras swim and dive perfectly, and thanks to the webbing on their feet, they feel confident in the water. They often rest in rivers and lakes to cool off from the heat or escape from predators. <mark>In the water, a capybara can hold its breath for up to five minutes.</mark></i></p>



<p><b>The basis of the capybara's diet is plant food:</b> grass, leaves, fruits, and aquatic plants. Sometimes they even eat their own undigested food to get more nutrients —<u>this is a characteristic feature of many herbivorous rodents.</u>Capybaras eat several times a day, most often in the morning and evening.

<p><u>These animals live in large groups — sometimes up to 20–30 individuals.</u> Inside the community, they have their own hierarchies, leaders, and rules. <i>Capybaras are very peaceful, so they often become an object of sympathy from humans. In zoos and petting parks, they easily get used to people and allow themselves to be petted.</i></p>
